In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a simulation of simple life forms in assembly language for the x8086 CPU, also known as Conway's Game of Life.
As the game is a "no player" game, the simulation is meant to show the behavior of the life forms with only an initial input from the player.
To enhance the user experience, we were also asked to implement some additional features, such as a ranking system, and a save function.
These features will allow players to track their progress and easily resume their games at a later time.
